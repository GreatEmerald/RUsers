**Repository of scripts from R user dicussion group (PE&RC graduate school)**

This repository belong to the R user discussion group of [PE&RC](https://www.pe-rc.nl/) graduate school of [Wageningen University](http://www.wur.nl/). It gives access to [R scripts](https://github.com/wageningen/RUsers/tree/master/Meeting_RScripts) presented during its meetings, [links](https://github.com/wageningen/RUsers/wiki) to R learning resources and [schedule](https://github.com/wageningen/RUsers/wiki/Meeting-schedule) of next meetings.

The Wageningen R user group is meant for all R users connected to graduate school PE&RC, and/or Wageningen University and Research,  and anybody else interested in working with R. Itâ€™s focus is the language R itself, rather than statistics in general. Most of our members are PhD candidates, but also Bachelor and Master students, and everybody else is welcome. Any questions, suggestions, or do you want te be informed about our monthly meetings? Contact us by r-users@wur.nl.
